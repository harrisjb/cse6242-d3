# OpioidMortality_GTWR analysis.R

This R file in this folder contains the code to run the geographic and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) anlaysis, where mortality rate is the outcome, and opioids in grams, population size, percent of the population that is white, median age, and median household income are the independent variables. 

## Key decisions made: 
  - mortality was expressed as a rate per 100,000 people for each county in each year, computed as the (mortality count/population size)*100,000. The mortality rate was log transformed, and coefficients approximate the percent change in mortality for every unit increase in each of the independent variables, adjusting for all other independent variables listed above
  - A fixed Gaussian kernel was used to calculate the spatiotemporal bandwidth, because this kernel had the lowest AIC
  - Excluded Hawaii/Alaska from analyses, due to large spatial distance from the rest of the US
  - Generated the coefficients for opioids as both scaled (per 1000 gram) and unscaled (per 1 gram). Recommend using the scaled variable to make more interpretable.
