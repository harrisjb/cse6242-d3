#### topojson

This utility code creates a cvs file `counties-10m.csv` from the `counties-10m.json`
The file allows the mapping of State and County Names in the DEA pill database to
names and FIPS codes used by topojson.

Additionally the file `state_codes_by_name.csv` is used to map state codes to the State Names used in topojson files.
